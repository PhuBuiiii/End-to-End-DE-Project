The world of data engineering is ever-changing, with new tools and technologies emerging on a regular basis. Building an effective analytics platform can be a daunting task, especially if you’re not familiar with all the tools available. How do you turn scattered, complex data into a model that drives insights and decision-making? In this course, Thalia Barrera teaches data professionals how to implement an end-to-end data engineering project using open tools from the modern data stack. She touches on best practices such as data modeling, testing, documentation and version control and shows you how to efficiently extract, load, and transform data into a unified, analytics-ready format. Thalia shows you how to confidently select and use tools through practical examples—taking you through the construction of a robust data pipeline for a fictional ecommerce company—and how to implement best practices in data engineering.
